To-do

* features to add
  - Documentation about Exemptions
      https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-historical-table-23
    for data in better format:
    https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-individual-income-tax-parameters
     CSV version of this file is in src/exemptions.csv
  - Merge basefigs.jl, taxSimFigs.jl
  - put taxSim into animation on github after 1962
  - update taxFoo.jl on github
* plots
  - if we treat tax rates as a CDF, what's the PDF of incomes?

Future features
* EITC
* the "Maximum tax on earned income" (explains diff in 1980 at high incomes
  between taxFoo.jl and Taxsim)
      https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1348-2
* medicare and social security
    https://www.milefoot.com/math/businessmath/taxes/fica.htm
* unemployment tax
* AMT?
* ? Medicare contribution tax
* Cap gains rates
  https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/whole-ball-of-tax-historical-capital-gains-rates
  https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/federal-capital-gains-tax-collections-historical-data/
  https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/federal-capital-gains-tax-rates-1988-2013/
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States

Questions for Daniel F (Taxsim guy)
* What tax is causing effective tax to go above the highest bracket in 1968?
* Have you had any thoughts of adding things before 1960?
* What's the status of putting Taxsim on Github?

    bD,dD,ssD,hiD,cD = initTables()

Read income tax brackets, tax deduction, Social Security tax, Medicare tax,
and CPI data into dicts from default CSV files contained alongside the
source code. Tax bracket data comes from taxfoundation.org [1], tax
deduction data comes from [2][3], Social Security and Medicare data comes
from [4], and CPI data is from the Minneapolis Fed [4].

'initTables' is tuned to the specific CSV files shipped alongside this code,
and would need to be carefully tuned for other files. I.e. this function is
pretty fragile (like the rest of taxFoo? :-).
